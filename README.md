packages.ts

The `packages.ts` file in the `resources` folder defines all promotional packages and special offers available at the service center.

- `packageTypes` interface ensures each package has a `title`, `desc` (description), `btn` (button text), and an `image`.
- `packageDetails` array lists all available offers, including Body Shop Offers, Oil Service Package, 25% off on Major Services, Labor Discount, and Exclusive Winter Offers.
- Each package includes a clear title, concise description, a call-to-action button, and a relevant image for visual emphasis.

This structured data allows the Packages page to dynamically render offer cards, making it easy for clients to understand, compare, and engage with promotions.

services.ts

The services.ts file defines all automotive services offered by the center and provides structured data for dynamic website rendering. Using the ServiceType interface, each service includes its name, images, heading, intro text, descriptions, features, reasons to choose it, and SEO metadata. The servicesData array lists all services, from AC Repair to Alloy Wheel Refurbishment, each with detailed content and SEO-friendly text. The findService function returns a service object based on a hyphenated, lowercase string, enabling dynamic page loading. This structure supports easy rendering, SEO optimization, and maintainable, scalable data management.

Highlights include a professional team with advanced tools, reliable service at fair prices, detailed vehicle diagnosis, quality spare parts, excellent customer service, and quick assistance during emergencies. This structured data can be used to dynamically display the company’s value propositions on the website.

### globals.css

located inside `app` directory

```
The globals.css file defines all global styling for the project using Tailwind CSS, including a custom theme with primary (#ffffff), secondary (#e01424), and text (#000000) colors to maintain consistent branding. It also provides reusable typography classes like .heading, .subHeading, and .normalText using @apply for clean, responsive text across all pages. Additionally, it includes small custom tweaks such as removing default list markers with .summary::marker. Overall, this file ensures unified design, readable typography, and scalable styling throughout the website.

```

### layout.tsx

located inside `app` directory

```
In layout.tsx, we include components that are used consistently across the entire application—such as <Navbar /> and <Footer />. Placing these globally ensures a unified structure, consistent user experience, and avoids repeating the same components on every individual page.

```

### page.tsx

located inside `app` directory

```
The page.tsx (Home Page) imports and renders all major sections of the landing page, including Banner, Offers, WhyChooseUS, FAQ, and the CarWorkshopForm. Each component is neatly separated for better readability and maintainability. Data-driven sections like WhyChooseUS and Faq receive their content through props, ensuring clean separation of UI and data. This structured approach keeps the home page modular, scalable, and easy to update.
